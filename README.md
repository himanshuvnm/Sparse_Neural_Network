# Sparse Neural Network

This repository demonstrates a sparse neural network using hard-threshold masking on learned mask parameters. The model learns a sparse linear transformation by pruning a fixed fraction of weights based on learned importance scores.

Output of this project are:

--- Training loss curve

--- Sparse weight visualization

--- Prediction vs ground truth plots
