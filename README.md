# Sparse Neural Network

This repository demonstrates a sparse neural network using hard-threshold masking on learned mask parameters. The model learns a sparse linear transformation by pruning a fixed fraction of weights based on learned importance scores. The goal is to study how structured sparsity can be learned in neural networks and how aggressive pruning affects model accuracy, stability, and generalization.
